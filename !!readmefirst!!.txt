Current directory structure is not directly usable for development

To develop and deploy, after got clone of the code, need adjust as follow：

1，create directory under current directory
   mkdir .\src\github.com\pchain\，

move all directories/files except '!!restore!!', '.git', '!!readmefirst!!.txt' to the newly created directory

2，copy all content under '!!restore!!' to current directory, now you can build and start pchain by using the scripts

details can be found in https://github.com/pchain-org/pchain/wiki/Build-and-start-pchain
